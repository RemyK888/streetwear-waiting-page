# üëï Streetwear waiting page

<h4>Having friends who have launched their own streetwear brand, it is for them that I designed this waiting page of their online shop. 
Well, they didn't like the page so I put it on Github for free access so that you can be inspired by it.</h4>

*The code is completely disgusting, but it's responsive and I find it rather abstract, aesthetic and modern.*

<br>
Well, I put a small picture of illustration here **(you can't see the animations nor the custom slider but everything is animated)**.
